Executive Summary\n\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\n\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 4. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 5. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\n\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 6. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\n\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 7. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\n\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 8. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 9. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 10. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\n\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 11. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 12. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\n\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 13. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\n\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 14. Clinical Considerations\n\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching."}, "v3": {"patient_id": "657bb4504d6f20696a5d5016", "employee_id": null, "baseline_report": {"1.

Executive Summary\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. AI Assessment Metadata (REQUIRED for FDA Explainability)\nProvide transparent assessment metadata for regulatory traceability:\n\n**overall_confidence** (0.0-1.0): Your confidence in this assessment based on data completeness and quality\n- 0.8-1.0: High confidence (complete data, clear patterns)\n- 0.5-0.79: Moderate confidence (some data gaps, inference needed)\n- 0.0-0.49: Low confidence (limited data, mostly baseline recommendations)\n\n**assessment_rationale**: Explain the basis for your assessment (2-3 sentences). What data sources informed your conclusions? What were the key clinical factors?\n\n**data_completeness**: Describe what data you had access to and any significant gaps.\n\n**primary_factors**: List 3-5 key factors that most influenced your assessment (e.g., \"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 8.2% - above target\", \"No recent glucose measurements\", \"Metformin medication - consider meal timing\").\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"assessment_rationale\": \"Assessment based on complete medical history, recent labs (3 months old), and 124 glucose measurements. Limited food log data required inference of typical dietary patterns from diagnosis and cultural background.\",\n  \"data_completeness\": \"Complete - patient history, medications, HbA1c 7.8%, 124 BG measurements over 6 months. Missing - recent food logs\",\n  \"primary_factors\": [\"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 7.8% (above target)\", \"Average BG 165 mg/dL\", \"Metformin 1000mg BID\", \"Self-reported inconsistent meal timing\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 5. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 6. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 7. Pattern Statistics (if food log data available - PRD Section 5)\nIf food logs are available, provide aggregate statistics for the RD dashboard:\n\n**balanced_percentage**: Percentage of meals that were balanced (0-100)\n**top_imbalances**: List 3-5 most common imbalances (e.g., [\"carb_heavy\", \"low_fiber\", \"missing_veg\"])\n**meal_frequency_per_week**: Average number of meals logged per week\n**consistency_score**: Assessment of logging consistency (e.g., \"Good - 5 days/week\", \"Irregular - 2-3 days/week\")\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null.\n\n### 8. Meal Pattern Labels (if food log data available - PRD Section 4)\nIf food logs are available, provide AI-assigned labels with explainability data:\n\nFor each recurring pattern, include:\n- **name**: Label name (carb_heavy, balanced, low_protein, missing_veg, fried_processed, sugary_drink_or_dessert, high_sodium_likely, low_fiber, high_added_fat, healthy_fat_present)\n- **confidence**: Confidence score 0.0-1.0\n- **triggers**: Evidence/foods that triggered this label (e.g., [\"fries\", \"bun\", \"sweet_drink\"])\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n[\n  {\"name\": \"carb_heavy\", \"confidence\": 0.82, \"triggers\": [\"pasta\", \"bread\", \"rice\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"missing_veg\", \"confidence\": 0.75, \"triggers\": [\"no_vegetables_observed\", \"corn_only\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"balanced\", \"confidence\": 0.65, \"triggers\": [\"protein_present\", \"vegetables_included\"]}\n]\n```\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null. These labels are critical for FDA explainability and RD review.\n\n### 9. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 10. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 11. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 12. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 13. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 14. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 15. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 16. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 17. Clinical Considerations\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching.\n"}}, "new_fields": {"v1": [], "v2": ["3. Positive Habits", "4. Improvement Areas", "5.

The BG management goal: \nTime in Range (TIR): Overall TIR for June was 72%, with 26% of readings in the 180‚Äì249 mg/dL range and 2% >250 mg/dL.\nNotably, in the past 2 weeks, there has been significant improvement, with 95% of readings in range and only 5% above range.\nThe improvement appears closely related to the patient‚Äôs dietary and exercise habits. The patient is currently consuming two low-carb protein shakes and one regular meal per day, with snacks consisting of broccoli and carrots for added fiber. The patient has also increased physical activity, attending the gym 4 times per week. According to the CGM device, estimated A1c has improved from 7.7% to 6.6%, reflecting excellent progress.\n2.

The BG management goal: \nTime in Range (TIR): Overall TIR for June was 72%, with 26% of readings in the 180‚Äì249 mg/dL range and 2% >250 mg/dL.\nNotably, in the past 2 weeks, there has been significant improvement, with 95% of readings in range and only 5% above range.\nThe improvement appears closely related to the patient‚Äôs dietary and exercise habits. The patient is currently consuming two low-carb protein shakes and one regular meal per day, with snacks consisting of broccoli and carrots for added fiber. The patient has also increased physical activity, attending the gym 4 times per week. According to the CGM device, estimated A1c has improved from 7.7% to 6.6%, reflecting excellent progress.\n2. The BP management goal: goal met \n30d 107/74 vs 90d 110/76 \nBP readings remain well controlled under the current medication regimen, with 91% of readings in the normal range. This is likely attributed to the patient‚Äôs consistent exercise routine. No concerns noted at this time.\n3. The weight management goal; \nInitial weight (5/5/25): 258 lbs (BMI: 40)\nCurrent weight: Maintained in the range of 255‚Äì260 lbs\nNo significant weight change observed, but weight is stable.\n\n\nLatest Visit Note\nDate: 2025-09-05\nNote Author: Celine Yin\nFollow-Up Visit Summary:\n\n- Completed follow-up visit with patient\n- In-clinic vitals: Blood pressure 108/78, heart rate 95\n- Reviewed patient's blood pressure readings with PCP\n- Average blood pressure for the month: 114/85 (within normal range); will continue to monitor\n- Check-in house A1C result: 7.2%\n- No changes reported regarding patient's medications\n- Patient declined an additional visit\n\n\n\n\n## Patient Health Goals\n\n\n\n## Laboratory Results\n\n\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze this patient's health information and create a comprehensive RD-facing nutrition baseline assessment following the format below:\n\n### 1. Executive Summary\n\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\n\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 4. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 5. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\n\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 6. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\n\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 7. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\n\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 8. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 9. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 10. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\n\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 11. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 12. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\n\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 13. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\n\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 14. Clinical Considerations\n\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching."}, "v3": {"patient_id": "645193ac60335a00138916f7", "employee_id": null, "baseline_report": {"1.

The BG management goal: \nTime in Range (TIR): Overall TIR for June was 72%, with 26% of readings in the 180‚Äì249 mg/dL range and 2% >250 mg/dL.\nNotably, in the past 2 weeks, there has been significant improvement, with 95% of readings in range and only 5% above range.\nThe improvement appears closely related to the patient‚Äôs dietary and exercise habits. The patient is currently consuming two low-carb protein shakes and one regular meal per day, with snacks consisting of broccoli and carrots for added fiber. The patient has also increased physical activity, attending the gym 4 times per week. According to the CGM device, estimated A1c has improved from 7.7% to 6.6%, reflecting excellent progress.\n2. The BP management goal: goal met \n30d 107/74 vs 90d 110/76 \nBP readings remain well controlled under the current medication regimen, with 91% of readings in the normal range. This is likely attributed to the patient‚Äôs consistent exercise routine. No concerns noted at this time.\n3. The weight management goal; \nInitial weight (5/5/25): 258 lbs (BMI: 40)\nCurrent weight: Maintained in the range of 255‚Äì260 lbs\nNo significant weight change observed, but weight is stable.\n\n\nLatest Visit Note\nDate: 2025-09-05\nNote Author: Celine Yin\nFollow-Up Visit Summary:\n\n- Completed follow-up visit with patient\n- In-clinic vitals: Blood pressure 108/78, heart rate 95\n- Reviewed patient's blood pressure readings with PCP\n- Average blood pressure for the month: 114/85 (within normal range); will continue to monitor\n- Check-in house A1C result: 7.2%\n- No changes reported regarding patient's medications\n- Patient declined an additional visit\n\n\n\n\nNote: The patient background information above includes comprehensive data: demographics, health conditions, medications, lifestyle assessment, vitals (weight, BMI), blood pressure/heart rate monitoring, CGM data (if available), blood glucose monitoring, laboratory results, clinical goals, behavioral goals, monthly treatment plan reviews, and visit notes.\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze this patient's health information and create a comprehensive RD-facing nutrition baseline assessment following the format below:\n\n### 1. Executive Summary\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. AI Assessment Metadata (REQUIRED for FDA Explainability)\nProvide transparent assessment metadata for regulatory traceability:\n\n**overall_confidence** (0.0-1.0): Your confidence in this assessment based on data completeness and quality\n- 0.8-1.0: High confidence (complete data, clear patterns)\n- 0.5-0.79: Moderate confidence (some data gaps, inference needed)\n- 0.0-0.49: Low confidence (limited data, mostly baseline recommendations)\n\n**assessment_rationale**: Explain the basis for your assessment (2-3 sentences). What data sources informed your conclusions? What were the key clinical factors?\n\n**data_completeness**: Describe what data you had access to and any significant gaps.\n\n**primary_factors**: List 3-5 key factors that most influenced your assessment (e.g., \"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 8.2% - above target\", \"No recent glucose measurements\", \"Metformin medication - consider meal timing\").\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"assessment_rationale\": \"Assessment based on complete medical history, recent labs (3 months old), and 124 glucose measurements. Limited food log data required inference of typical dietary patterns from diagnosis and cultural background.\",\n  \"data_completeness\": \"Complete - patient history, medications, HbA1c 7.8%, 124 BG measurements over 6 months. Missing - recent food logs\",\n  \"primary_factors\": [\"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 7.8% (above target)\", \"Average BG 165 mg/dL\", \"Metformin 1000mg BID\", \"Self-reported inconsistent meal timing\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 5. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 6. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 7. Pattern Statistics (if food log data available - PRD Section 5)\nIf food logs are available, provide aggregate statistics for the RD dashboard:\n\n**balanced_percentage**: Percentage of meals that were balanced (0-100)\n**top_imbalances**: List 3-5 most common imbalances (e.g., [\"carb_heavy\", \"low_fiber\", \"missing_veg\"])\n**meal_frequency_per_week**: Average number of meals logged per week\n**consistency_score**: Assessment of logging consistency (e.g., \"Good - 5 days/week\", \"Irregular - 2-3 days/week\")\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null.\n\n### 8. Meal Pattern Labels (if food log data available - PRD Section 4)\nIf food logs are available, provide AI-assigned labels with explainability data:\n\nFor each recurring pattern, include:\n- **name**: Label name (carb_heavy, balanced, low_protein, missing_veg, fried_processed, sugary_drink_or_dessert, high_sodium_likely, low_fiber, high_added_fat, healthy_fat_present)\n- **confidence**: Confidence score 0.0-1.0\n- **triggers**: Evidence/foods that triggered this label (e.g., [\"fries\", \"bun\", \"sweet_drink\"])\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n[\n  {\"name\": \"carb_heavy\", \"confidence\": 0.82, \"triggers\": [\"pasta\", \"bread\", \"rice\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"missing_veg\", \"confidence\": 0.75, \"triggers\": [\"no_vegetables_observed\", \"corn_only\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"balanced\", \"confidence\": 0.65, \"triggers\": [\"protein_present\", \"vegetables_included\"]}\n]\n```\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null. These labels are critical for FDA explainability and RD review.\n\n### 9. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 10. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 11. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 12. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 13. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 14. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 15. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 16. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 17. Clinical Considerations\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching.\n"}}, "new_fields": {"v1": [], "v2": ["3. Positive Habits", "4. Improvement Areas", "5.

Diagnosed with dm 2 years ago, and has a strong desire to get off meds. Kids are all grown and out of the house, and pt just retired 2 wks ago and now able to focus on herself. Patient is well aware of body physiology and what foods affect glucose, generally aware of foods that are healthy, but not always clear on the reasons why. \nConcerns- \n1- low muscle mass, becoming active will help control glucise\n2- cravings for sweets are frequent and often late at night, resulting in high BG. \n3- Poor sleep quality related to long-term noc shift work schedule recently stopped, may take some time for sleep quality to improve. \nGoals: \n1- reduce carbs at bedtime snack from simple sugars (reduce sees candies to every other day), and eat snacks that are rich in protein and complex carbs- whole grain crackers and cheese, 2 cups popped popcorn, or whole grain toast and peanut butter. Send pictures in the chat of any snacks you are wondering about, and I can help you!  \n2- If checking glucose with fingerstick, check before and 2 hours after the meal to see how glucose changes and figure out what works best for you. \n3- Boost muscle mass to help stabilize glucose by increasing uptake in muscle even at baseline. \n\n\n\n## Patient Health Goals\n\n\n\n## Laboratory Results\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze this patient's health information and provide a comprehensive nutrition baseline assessment that includes:\n\n1. **Executive Summary**: Provide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n2. **Data Coverage**: Note what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, lifestyle, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n3. **Macronutrient Analysis**:\n    - Based on patient's current health status, medications, and conditions, provide recommendations for:\n        - Daily calorie targets\n        - Protein requirements\n        - Carbohydrate quality and quantity recommendations\n        - Fat intake recommendations\n        - Fiber targets\n4. **Meal Timing and Patterns**:\n    - Recommend ideal meal frequency and timing for this patient\n    - Special considerations based on medications or health conditions\n5. **Food Choices Analysis**:\n    - Recommend beneficial food groups and specific foods\n    - Foods to limit or avoid based on health conditions\n    - Assessment of nutritional needs for dietary variety\n6. **Key Nutrition Patterns** (3-5 focus areas):\n    - Identify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile\n    - Note potential impact of addressing each priority\n7. **Lab Correlations** (if labs available):\n    - Connect lab values to nutrition interventions\n    - Explain how dietary changes could impact specific lab metrics\n    - Highlight any concerning trends requiring dietary intervention\n8. **Prioritized Recommendations** (3-7 recommendations):\n    - Provide specific, actionable recommendations\n    - Prioritize by High/Medium/Low priority\n    - Include rationale for each recommendation\n    - Consider the patient's health goals and current barriers\n9. **Clinical Considerations**:\n    - Flag any concerning health indicators requiring immediate attention\n    - Note potential medication-nutrition interactions\n    - Identify areas requiring close monitoring\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Be Professional and Empathetic**: Use supportive, non-judgmental language\n- **Be Specific**: Provide concrete, actionable guidance\n- **Be Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Be Realistic**: Consider the patient's stated goals and potential constraints\n- **Be Action-Oriented**: Make recommendations practical and achievable\n- **Consider Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**.

Diagnosed with dm 2 years ago, and has a strong desire to get off meds. Kids are all grown and out of the house, and pt just retired 2 wks ago and now able to focus on herself. Patient is well aware of body physiology and what foods affect glucose, generally aware of foods that are healthy, but not always clear on the reasons why. \nConcerns- \n1- low muscle mass, becoming active will help control glucise\n2- cravings for sweets are frequent and often late at night, resulting in high BG. \n3- Poor sleep quality related to long-term noc shift work schedule recently stopped, may take some time for sleep quality to improve. \nGoals: \n1- reduce carbs at bedtime snack from simple sugars (reduce sees candies to every other day), and eat snacks that are rich in protein and complex carbs- whole grain crackers and cheese, 2 cups popped popcorn, or whole grain toast and peanut butter. Send pictures in the chat of any snacks you are wondering about, and I can help you!  \n2- If checking glucose with fingerstick, check before and 2 hours after the meal to see how glucose changes and figure out what works best for you. \n3- Boost muscle mass to help stabilize glucose by increasing uptake in muscle even at baseline. \n\n\n\n## Patient Health Goals\n\n\n\n## Laboratory Results\n\n\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze this patient's health information and create a comprehensive RD-facing nutrition baseline assessment following the format below:\n\n### 1. Executive Summary\n\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\n\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 4. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 5. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\n\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 6. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\n\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 7. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\n\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 8. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 9. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 10. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\n\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 11. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 12. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\n\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 13. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\n\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 14. Clinical Considerations\n\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching."}, "v3": {"patient_id": "686432095aa45b1a2aa7f484", "employee_id": null, "baseline_report": {"1.

Diagnosed with dm 2 years ago, and has a strong desire to get off meds. Kids are all grown and out of the house, and pt just retired 2 wks ago and now able to focus on herself. Patient is well aware of body physiology and what foods affect glucose, generally aware of foods that are healthy, but not always clear on the reasons why. \nConcerns- \n1- low muscle mass, becoming active will help control glucise\n2- cravings for sweets are frequent and often late at night, resulting in high BG. \n3- Poor sleep quality related to long-term noc shift work schedule recently stopped, may take some time for sleep quality to improve. \nGoals: \n1- reduce carbs at bedtime snack from simple sugars (reduce sees candies to every other day), and eat snacks that are rich in protein and complex carbs- whole grain crackers and cheese, 2 cups popped popcorn, or whole grain toast and peanut butter. Send pictures in the chat of any snacks you are wondering about, and I can help you!  \n2- If checking glucose with fingerstick, check before and 2 hours after the meal to see how glucose changes and figure out what works best for you. \n3- Boost muscle mass to help stabilize glucose by increasing uptake in muscle even at baseline. \n\n\n\nNote: The patient background information above includes comprehensive data: demographics, health conditions, medications, lifestyle assessment, vitals (weight, BMI), blood pressure/heart rate monitoring, CGM data (if available), blood glucose monitoring, laboratory results, clinical goals, behavioral goals, monthly treatment plan reviews, and visit notes.\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze this patient's health information and create a comprehensive RD-facing nutrition baseline assessment following the format below:\n\n### 1. Executive Summary\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. AI Assessment Metadata (REQUIRED for FDA Explainability)\nProvide transparent assessment metadata for regulatory traceability:\n\n**overall_confidence** (0.0-1.0): Your confidence in this assessment based on data completeness and quality\n- 0.8-1.0: High confidence (complete data, clear patterns)\n- 0.5-0.79: Moderate confidence (some data gaps, inference needed)\n- 0.0-0.49: Low confidence (limited data, mostly baseline recommendations)\n\n**assessment_rationale**: Explain the basis for your assessment (2-3 sentences). What data sources informed your conclusions? What were the key clinical factors?\n\n**data_completeness**: Describe what data you had access to and any significant gaps.\n\n**primary_factors**: List 3-5 key factors that most influenced your assessment (e.g., \"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 8.2% - above target\", \"No recent glucose measurements\", \"Metformin medication - consider meal timing\").\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"assessment_rationale\": \"Assessment based on complete medical history, recent labs (3 months old), and 124 glucose measurements. Limited food log data required inference of typical dietary patterns from diagnosis and cultural background.\",\n  \"data_completeness\": \"Complete - patient history, medications, HbA1c 7.8%, 124 BG measurements over 6 months. Missing - recent food logs\",\n  \"primary_factors\": [\"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 7.8% (above target)\", \"Average BG 165 mg/dL\", \"Metformin 1000mg BID\", \"Self-reported inconsistent meal timing\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 5. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 6. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 7. Pattern Statistics (if food log data available - PRD Section 5)\nIf food logs are available, provide aggregate statistics for the RD dashboard:\n\n**balanced_percentage**: Percentage of meals that were balanced (0-100)\n**top_imbalances**: List 3-5 most common imbalances (e.g., [\"carb_heavy\", \"low_fiber\", \"missing_veg\"])\n**meal_frequency_per_week**: Average number of meals logged per week\n**consistency_score**: Assessment of logging consistency (e.g., \"Good - 5 days/week\", \"Irregular - 2-3 days/week\")\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null.\n\n### 8. Meal Pattern Labels (if food log data available - PRD Section 4)\nIf food logs are available, provide AI-assigned labels with explainability data:\n\nFor each recurring pattern, include:\n- **name**: Label name (carb_heavy, balanced, low_protein, missing_veg, fried_processed, sugary_drink_or_dessert, high_sodium_likely, low_fiber, high_added_fat, healthy_fat_present)\n- **confidence**: Confidence score 0.0-1.0\n- **triggers**: Evidence/foods that triggered this label (e.g., [\"fries\", \"bun\", \"sweet_drink\"])\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n[\n  {\"name\": \"carb_heavy\", \"confidence\": 0.82, \"triggers\": [\"pasta\", \"bread\", \"rice\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"missing_veg\", \"confidence\": 0.75, \"triggers\": [\"no_vegetables_observed\", \"corn_only\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"balanced\", \"confidence\": 0.65, \"triggers\": [\"protein_present\", \"vegetables_included\"]}\n]\n```\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null. These labels are critical for FDA explainability and RD review.\n\n### 9. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 10. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 11. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 12. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 13. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 14. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 15. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 16. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 17. Clinical Considerations\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching.\n"}}, "new_fields": {"v1": [], "v2": ["3. Positive Habits", "4. Improvement Areas", "5.

Executive Summary\n\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\n\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 4. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 5. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\n\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 6. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\n\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 7. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\n\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 8. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 9. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 10. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\n\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 11. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 12. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\n\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 13. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\n\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 14. Clinical Considerations\n\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching."}, "v3": {"patient_id": "65ccf7012bf2b30013040bd8", "employee_id": null, "baseline_report": {"1.

Executive Summary\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. AI Assessment Metadata (REQUIRED for FDA Explainability)\nProvide transparent assessment metadata for regulatory traceability:\n\n**overall_confidence** (0.0-1.0): Your confidence in this assessment based on data completeness and quality\n- 0.8-1.0: High confidence (complete data, clear patterns)\n- 0.5-0.79: Moderate confidence (some data gaps, inference needed)\n- 0.0-0.49: Low confidence (limited data, mostly baseline recommendations)\n\n**assessment_rationale**: Explain the basis for your assessment (2-3 sentences). What data sources informed your conclusions? What were the key clinical factors?\n\n**data_completeness**: Describe what data you had access to and any significant gaps.\n\n**primary_factors**: List 3-5 key factors that most influenced your assessment (e.g., \"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 8.2% - above target\", \"No recent glucose measurements\", \"Metformin medication - consider meal timing\").\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"assessment_rationale\": \"Assessment based on complete medical history, recent labs (3 months old), and 124 glucose measurements. Limited food log data required inference of typical dietary patterns from diagnosis and cultural background.\",\n  \"data_completeness\": \"Complete - patient history, medications, HbA1c 7.8%, 124 BG measurements over 6 months. Missing - recent food logs\",\n  \"primary_factors\": [\"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 7.8% (above target)\", \"Average BG 165 mg/dL\", \"Metformin 1000mg BID\", \"Self-reported inconsistent meal timing\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 5. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 6. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 7. Pattern Statistics (if food log data available - PRD Section 5)\nIf food logs are available, provide aggregate statistics for the RD dashboard:\n\n**balanced_percentage**: Percentage of meals that were balanced (0-100)\n**top_imbalances**: List 3-5 most common imbalances (e.g., [\"carb_heavy\", \"low_fiber\", \"missing_veg\"])\n**meal_frequency_per_week**: Average number of meals logged per week\n**consistency_score**: Assessment of logging consistency (e.g., \"Good - 5 days/week\", \"Irregular - 2-3 days/week\")\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null.\n\n### 8. Meal Pattern Labels (if food log data available - PRD Section 4)\nIf food logs are available, provide AI-assigned labels with explainability data:\n\nFor each recurring pattern, include:\n- **name**: Label name (carb_heavy, balanced, low_protein, missing_veg, fried_processed, sugary_drink_or_dessert, high_sodium_likely, low_fiber, high_added_fat, healthy_fat_present)\n- **confidence**: Confidence score 0.0-1.0\n- **triggers**: Evidence/foods that triggered this label (e.g., [\"fries\", \"bun\", \"sweet_drink\"])\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n[\n  {\"name\": \"carb_heavy\", \"confidence\": 0.82, \"triggers\": [\"pasta\", \"bread\", \"rice\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"missing_veg\", \"confidence\": 0.75, \"triggers\": [\"no_vegetables_observed\", \"corn_only\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"balanced\", \"confidence\": 0.65, \"triggers\": [\"protein_present\", \"vegetables_included\"]}\n]\n```\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null. These labels are critical for FDA explainability and RD review.\n\n### 9. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 10. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 11. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 12. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 13. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 14. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 15. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 16. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 17. Clinical Considerations\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching.\n"}}, "new_fields": {"v1": [], "v2": ["1. Executive Summary", "2. Data Coverage", "3. Positive Habits", "4.

Executive Summary\n\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\n\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 4. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 5. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\n\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 6. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\n\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 7. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\n\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 8. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 9. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 10. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\n\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 11. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 12. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\n\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 13. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\n\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 14. Clinical Considerations\n\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching."}, "v3": {"patient_id": "641899cd02638200134171ab", "employee_id": null, "baseline_report": {"1.

While at the clinic PT had to go through a couple of passwords to get their account to link. Once he had figured out the proper password we were able to link through libreview and get their data shared. PT left satisfied with their visit!\n\n\n\nNote: The patient background information above includes comprehensive data: demographics, health conditions, medications, lifestyle assessment, vitals (weight, BMI), blood pressure/heart rate monitoring, CGM data (if available), blood glucose monitoring, laboratory results, clinical goals, behavioral goals, monthly treatment plan reviews, and visit notes.\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze this patient's health information and create a comprehensive RD-facing nutrition baseline assessment following the format below:\n\n### 1. Executive Summary\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. AI Assessment Metadata (REQUIRED for FDA Explainability)\nProvide transparent assessment metadata for regulatory traceability:\n\n**overall_confidence** (0.0-1.0): Your confidence in this assessment based on data completeness and quality\n- 0.8-1.0: High confidence (complete data, clear patterns)\n- 0.5-0.79: Moderate confidence (some data gaps, inference needed)\n- 0.0-0.49: Low confidence (limited data, mostly baseline recommendations)\n\n**assessment_rationale**: Explain the basis for your assessment (2-3 sentences). What data sources informed your conclusions? What were the key clinical factors?\n\n**data_completeness**: Describe what data you had access to and any significant gaps.\n\n**primary_factors**: List 3-5 key factors that most influenced your assessment (e.g., \"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 8.2% - above target\", \"No recent glucose measurements\", \"Metformin medication - consider meal timing\").\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"assessment_rationale\": \"Assessment based on complete medical history, recent labs (3 months old), and 124 glucose measurements. Limited food log data required inference of typical dietary patterns from diagnosis and cultural background.\",\n  \"data_completeness\": \"Complete - patient history, medications, HbA1c 7.8%, 124 BG measurements over 6 months. Missing - recent food logs\",\n  \"primary_factors\": [\"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 7.8% (above target)\", \"Average BG 165 mg/dL\", \"Metformin 1000mg BID\", \"Self-reported inconsistent meal timing\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 5. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 6. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 7. Pattern Statistics (if food log data available - PRD Section 5)\nIf food logs are available, provide aggregate statistics for the RD dashboard:\n\n**balanced_percentage**: Percentage of meals that were balanced (0-100)\n**top_imbalances**: List 3-5 most common imbalances (e.g., [\"carb_heavy\", \"low_fiber\", \"missing_veg\"])\n**meal_frequency_per_week**: Average number of meals logged per week\n**consistency_score**: Assessment of logging consistency (e.g., \"Good - 5 days/week\", \"Irregular - 2-3 days/week\")\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null.\n\n### 8. Meal Pattern Labels (if food log data available - PRD Section 4)\nIf food logs are available, provide AI-assigned labels with explainability data:\n\nFor each recurring pattern, include:\n- **name**: Label name (carb_heavy, balanced, low_protein, missing_veg, fried_processed, sugary_drink_or_dessert, high_sodium_likely, low_fiber, high_added_fat, healthy_fat_present)\n- **confidence**: Confidence score 0.0-1.0\n- **triggers**: Evidence/foods that triggered this label (e.g., [\"fries\", \"bun\", \"sweet_drink\"])\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n[\n  {\"name\": \"carb_heavy\", \"confidence\": 0.82, \"triggers\": [\"pasta\", \"bread\", \"rice\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"missing_veg\", \"confidence\": 0.75, \"triggers\": [\"no_vegetables_observed\", \"corn_only\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"balanced\", \"confidence\": 0.65, \"triggers\": [\"protein_present\", \"vegetables_included\"]}\n]\n```\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null. These labels are critical for FDA explainability and RD review.\n\n### 9. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 10. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 11. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 12. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 13. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 14. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 15. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 16. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 17. Clinical Considerations\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching.\n"}}, "new_fields": {"v1": [], "v2": ["1. Executive Summary", "2. Data Coverage", "3. Positive Habits", "4.

Executive Summary\n\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\n\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 4. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 5. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\n\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 6. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\n\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 7. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\n\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 8. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 9. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 10. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\n\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 11. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 12. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\n\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 13. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\n\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 14. Clinical Considerations\n\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified.

Executive Summary\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. AI Assessment Metadata (REQUIRED for FDA Explainability)\nProvide transparent assessment metadata for regulatory traceability:\n\n**overall_confidence** (0.0-1.0): Your confidence in this assessment based on data completeness and quality\n- 0.8-1.0: High confidence (complete data, clear patterns)\n- 0.5-0.79: Moderate confidence (some data gaps, inference needed)\n- 0.0-0.49: Low confidence (limited data, mostly baseline recommendations)\n\n**assessment_rationale**: Explain the basis for your assessment (2-3 sentences). What data sources informed your conclusions? What were the key clinical factors?\n\n**data_completeness**: Describe what data you had access to and any significant gaps.\n\n**primary_factors**: List 3-5 key factors that most influenced your assessment (e.g., \"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 8.2% - above target\", \"No recent glucose measurements\", \"Metformin medication - consider meal timing\").\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"assessment_rationale\": \"Assessment based on complete medical history, recent labs (3 months old), and 124 glucose measurements. Limited food log data required inference of typical dietary patterns from diagnosis and cultural background.\",\n  \"data_completeness\": \"Complete - patient history, medications, HbA1c 7.8%, 124 BG measurements over 6 months. Missing - recent food logs\",\n  \"primary_factors\": [\"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 7.8% (above target)\", \"Average BG 165 mg/dL\", \"Metformin 1000mg BID\", \"Self-reported inconsistent meal timing\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 5. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 6. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 7. Pattern Statistics (if food log data available - PRD Section 5)\nIf food logs are available, provide aggregate statistics for the RD dashboard:\n\n**balanced_percentage**: Percentage of meals that were balanced (0-100)\n**top_imbalances**: List 3-5 most common imbalances (e.g., [\"carb_heavy\", \"low_fiber\", \"missing_veg\"])\n**meal_frequency_per_week**: Average number of meals logged per week\n**consistency_score**: Assessment of logging consistency (e.g., \"Good - 5 days/week\", \"Irregular - 2-3 days/week\")\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null.\n\n### 8. Meal Pattern Labels (if food log data available - PRD Section 4)\nIf food logs are available, provide AI-assigned labels with explainability data:\n\nFor each recurring pattern, include:\n- **name**: Label name (carb_heavy, balanced, low_protein, missing_veg, fried_processed, sugary_drink_or_dessert, high_sodium_likely, low_fiber, high_added_fat, healthy_fat_present)\n- **confidence**: Confidence score 0.0-1.0\n- **triggers**: Evidence/foods that triggered this label (e.g., [\"fries\", \"bun\", \"sweet_drink\"])\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n[\n  {\"name\": \"carb_heavy\", \"confidence\": 0.82, \"triggers\": [\"pasta\", \"bread\", \"rice\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"missing_veg\", \"confidence\": 0.75, \"triggers\": [\"no_vegetables_observed\", \"corn_only\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"balanced\", \"confidence\": 0.65, \"triggers\": [\"protein_present\", \"vegetables_included\"]}\n]\n```\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null. These labels are critical for FDA explainability and RD review.\n\n### 9. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 10. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 11. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 12. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 13. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 14. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 15. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 16. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 17. Clinical Considerations\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching.\n"}}, "new_fields": {"v1": [], "v2": ["3. Positive Habits", "4. Improvement Areas", "5.

A1c: 6.4%\n  Per EHR record, the patient's weight is showing a trend down since March 10, 2025, going from 227.2 (BMI: 36.67), to 219.6 (BMI: 35..4) on 08/07/25.\n* Previous interventions focused on weekly aerobic exercise (2-3 days weekly for 30 min), increasing daily hydration (8+ cups of water per day) and including omega 3 food sources most days of the week.\n* Next steps/follow-up: RD/CDCES provided patient with a summary of her progress via chat, and commended her significant improvements. RD inquired about her goal progress and tolerance of GLP-1 medication. Next RD/CDCES visit will be on 10/10/25. Next Endo visit is on 10/22/25.&#x20;\n\n\nLatest Visit Note\nDate: 2025-07-28\nNote Author: Jonathan Gonzalez, RD\nAdditional visit completed. See summary:\n* Vitals trends reviewed: 90 day BG avg is 202 mg/dL from 10 readings  \n* Meds: metformin and rybelsus being taken more regularly as of 1 week ago. Patient still not taking glimepiride.\n* July abs reviewed with A1c at 10.6% and higher compared to the previous result of 9.2%. Her lipid panel showed a low HDL and elevated LDL of 101\n* Notable lifestyle patterns: patient continues to follow a vegan diet. She recently started intermittent fasting 16:8 (eats 12 PM - 8PM) ‚Äì reports headaches in the afternoon. Exercise started - walked recently on the levy for 2 miles and plants to incorporate more weekly. Undergoing a lot of stress d/t loss of staff and increased workload.\n* Clinical observations: poor glycemic control with her recent A1c increased to 10.6%, likely r/t  various lifestyle factors including stress, alcohol consumption and patient previously not taking medications as prescribed.\n* Interventions: Patient is now following up with an Endocrinologist and started monitoring with a Freestyle Libre 3. RD/CDCES initiated process for linking CGM data for support with pattern mgmt. RD discussed solutions to support rybelsus tolerance to promote adherence. RD created goals with the patient today to support improved progress including increasing hydration, activity and omega 3 intake.\n* Goals: Aim to increase moderate intensity aerobic physical activity to 30+ minutes 2-3 times per week or more over the next 3-6 months (partially met)\nIncrease resistance/strength training 2 times per week or more over the next 3-6 months (not met)\nAim to consume around 8-9 glasses of water per day over the next 3-6 months (New)\nConsume some plant-based omega 3 sources (e.g. 1 ounce of walnuts) most days of the week over the  month to support heart health.\n\n\n\n## Patient Health Goals\n\n\n\n## Laboratory Results\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze this patient's health information and provide a comprehensive nutrition baseline assessment that includes:\n\n1. **Executive Summary**: Provide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n2. **Data Coverage**: Note what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, lifestyle, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n3. **Macronutrient Analysis**:\n    - Based on patient's current health status, medications, and conditions, provide recommendations for:\n        - Daily calorie targets\n        - Protein requirements\n        - Carbohydrate quality and quantity recommendations\n        - Fat intake recommendations\n        - Fiber targets\n4. **Meal Timing and Patterns**:\n    - Recommend ideal meal frequency and timing for this patient\n    - Special considerations based on medications or health conditions\n5. **Food Choices Analysis**:\n    - Recommend beneficial food groups and specific foods\n    - Foods to limit or avoid based on health conditions\n    - Assessment of nutritional needs for dietary variety\n6. **Key Nutrition Patterns** (3-5 focus areas):\n    - Identify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile\n    - Note potential impact of addressing each priority\n7. **Lab Correlations** (if labs available):\n    - Connect lab values to nutrition interventions\n    - Explain how dietary changes could impact specific lab metrics\n    - Highlight any concerning trends requiring dietary intervention\n8. **Prioritized Recommendations** (3-7 recommendations):\n    - Provide specific, actionable recommendations\n    - Prioritize by High/Medium/Low priority\n    - Include rationale for each recommendation\n    - Consider the patient's health goals and current barriers\n9. **Clinical Considerations**:\n    - Flag any concerning health indicators requiring immediate attention\n    - Note potential medication-nutrition interactions\n    - Identify areas requiring close monitoring\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Be Professional and Empathetic**: Use supportive, non-judgmental language\n- **Be Specific**: Provide concrete, actionable guidance\n- **Be Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Be Realistic**: Consider the patient's stated goals and potential constraints\n- **Be Action-Oriented**: Make recommendations practical and achievable\n- **Consider Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**.

A1c: 6.4%\n  Per EHR record, the patient's weight is showing a trend down since March 10, 2025, going from 227.2 (BMI: 36.67), to 219.6 (BMI: 35..4) on 08/07/25.\n* Previous interventions focused on weekly aerobic exercise (2-3 days weekly for 30 min), increasing daily hydration (8+ cups of water per day) and including omega 3 food sources most days of the week.\n* Next steps/follow-up: RD/CDCES provided patient with a summary of her progress via chat, and commended her significant improvements. RD inquired about her goal progress and tolerance of GLP-1 medication. Next RD/CDCES visit will be on 10/10/25. Next Endo visit is on 10/22/25.&#x20;\n\n\nLatest Visit Note\nDate: 2025-07-28\nNote Author: Jonathan Gonzalez, RD\nAdditional visit completed. See summary:\n* Vitals trends reviewed: 90 day BG avg is 202 mg/dL from 10 readings  \n* Meds: metformin and rybelsus being taken more regularly as of 1 week ago. Patient still not taking glimepiride.\n* July abs reviewed with A1c at 10.6% and higher compared to the previous result of 9.2%. Her lipid panel showed a low HDL and elevated LDL of 101\n* Notable lifestyle patterns: patient continues to follow a vegan diet. She recently started intermittent fasting 16:8 (eats 12 PM - 8PM) ‚Äì reports headaches in the afternoon. Exercise started - walked recently on the levy for 2 miles and plants to incorporate more weekly. Undergoing a lot of stress d/t loss of staff and increased workload.\n* Clinical observations: poor glycemic control with her recent A1c increased to 10.6%, likely r/t  various lifestyle factors including stress, alcohol consumption and patient previously not taking medications as prescribed.\n* Interventions: Patient is now following up with an Endocrinologist and started monitoring with a Freestyle Libre 3. RD/CDCES initiated process for linking CGM data for support with pattern mgmt. RD discussed solutions to support rybelsus tolerance to promote adherence. RD created goals with the patient today to support improved progress including increasing hydration, activity and omega 3 intake.\n* Goals: Aim to increase moderate intensity aerobic physical activity to 30+ minutes 2-3 times per week or more over the next 3-6 months (partially met)\nIncrease resistance/strength training 2 times per week or more over the next 3-6 months (not met)\nAim to consume around 8-9 glasses of water per day over the next 3-6 months (New)\nConsume some plant-based omega 3 sources (e.g. 1 ounce of walnuts) most days of the week over the  month to support heart health.\n\n\n\n## Patient Health Goals\n\n\n\n## Laboratory Results\n\n\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze this patient's health information and create a comprehensive RD-facing nutrition baseline assessment following the format below:\n\n### 1. Executive Summary\n\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\n\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 4. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 5. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\n\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 6. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\n\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 7. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\n\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 8. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 9. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 10. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\n\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 11. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 12. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\n\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 13. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\n\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 14. Clinical Considerations\n\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching."}, "v3": {"patient_id": "64f75ca9fef7a400130fb760", "employee_id": null, "baseline_report": {"1.

A1c: 6.4%\n  Per EHR record, the patient's weight is showing a trend down since March 10, 2025, going from 227.2 (BMI: 36.67), to 219.6 (BMI: 35..4) on 08/07/25.\n* Previous interventions focused on weekly aerobic exercise (2-3 days weekly for 30 min), increasing daily hydration (8+ cups of water per day) and including omega 3 food sources most days of the week.\n* Next steps/follow-up: RD/CDCES provided patient with a summary of her progress via chat, and commended her significant improvements. RD inquired about her goal progress and tolerance of GLP-1 medication. Next RD/CDCES visit will be on 10/10/25. Next Endo visit is on 10/22/25.&#x20;\n\n\nLatest Visit Note\nDate: 2025-07-28\nNote Author: Jonathan Gonzalez, RD\nAdditional visit completed. See summary:\n* Vitals trends reviewed: 90 day BG avg is 202 mg/dL from 10 readings  \n* Meds: metformin and rybelsus being taken more regularly as of 1 week ago. Patient still not taking glimepiride.\n* July abs reviewed with A1c at 10.6% and higher compared to the previous result of 9.2%. Her lipid panel showed a low HDL and elevated LDL of 101\n* Notable lifestyle patterns: patient continues to follow a vegan diet. She recently started intermittent fasting 16:8 (eats 12 PM - 8PM) ‚Äì reports headaches in the afternoon. Exercise started - walked recently on the levy for 2 miles and plants to incorporate more weekly. Undergoing a lot of stress d/t loss of staff and increased workload.\n* Clinical observations: poor glycemic control with her recent A1c increased to 10.6%, likely r/t  various lifestyle factors including stress, alcohol consumption and patient previously not taking medications as prescribed.\n* Interventions: Patient is now following up with an Endocrinologist and started monitoring with a Freestyle Libre 3. RD/CDCES initiated process for linking CGM data for support with pattern mgmt. RD discussed solutions to support rybelsus tolerance to promote adherence. RD created goals with the patient today to support improved progress including increasing hydration, activity and omega 3 intake.\n* Goals: Aim to increase moderate intensity aerobic physical activity to 30+ minutes 2-3 times per week or more over the next 3-6 months (partially met)\nIncrease resistance/strength training 2 times per week or more over the next 3-6 months (not met)\nAim to consume around 8-9 glasses of water per day over the next 3-6 months (New)\nConsume some plant-based omega 3 sources (e.g. 1 ounce of walnuts) most days of the week over the  month to support heart health.\n\n\n\nNote: The patient background information above includes comprehensive data: demographics, health conditions, medications, lifestyle assessment, vitals (weight, BMI), blood pressure/heart rate monitoring, CGM data (if available), blood glucose monitoring, laboratory results, clinical goals, behavioral goals, monthly treatment plan reviews, and visit notes.\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze this patient's health information and create a comprehensive RD-facing nutrition baseline assessment following the format below:\n\n### 1. Executive Summary\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2.

AI Assessment Metadata (REQUIRED for FDA Explainability)\nProvide transparent assessment metadata for regulatory traceability:\n\n**overall_confidence** (0.0-1.0): Your confidence in this assessment based on data completeness and quality\n- 0.8-1.0: High confidence (complete data, clear patterns)\n- 0.5-0.79: Moderate confidence (some data gaps, inference needed)\n- 0.0-0.49: Low confidence (limited data, mostly baseline recommendations)\n\n**assessment_rationale**: Explain the basis for your assessment (2-3 sentences). What data sources informed your conclusions? What were the key clinical factors?\n\n**data_completeness**: Describe what data you had access to and any significant gaps.\n\n**primary_factors**: List 3-5 key factors that most influenced your assessment (e.g., \"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 8.2% - above target\", \"No recent glucose measurements\", \"Metformin medication - consider meal timing\").\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"assessment_rationale\": \"Assessment based on complete medical history, recent labs (3 months old), and 124 glucose measurements. Limited food log data required inference of typical dietary patterns from diagnosis and cultural background.\",\n  \"data_completeness\": \"Complete - patient history, medications, HbA1c 7.8%, 124 BG measurements over 6 months. Missing - recent food logs\",\n  \"primary_factors\": [\"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 7.8% (above target)\", \"Average BG 165 mg/dL\", \"Metformin 1000mg BID\", \"Self-reported inconsistent meal timing\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 5. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 6. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 7. Pattern Statistics (if food log data available - PRD Section 5)\nIf food logs are available, provide aggregate statistics for the RD dashboard:\n\n**balanced_percentage**: Percentage of meals that were balanced (0-100)\n**top_imbalances**: List 3-5 most common imbalances (e.g., [\"carb_heavy\", \"low_fiber\", \"missing_veg\"])\n**meal_frequency_per_week**: Average number of meals logged per week\n**consistency_score**: Assessment of logging consistency (e.g., \"Good - 5 days/week\", \"Irregular - 2-3 days/week\")\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null.\n\n### 8. Meal Pattern Labels (if food log data available - PRD Section 4)\nIf food logs are available, provide AI-assigned labels with explainability data:\n\nFor each recurring pattern, include:\n- **name**: Label name (carb_heavy, balanced, low_protein, missing_veg, fried_processed, sugary_drink_or_dessert, high_sodium_likely, low_fiber, high_added_fat, healthy_fat_present)\n- **confidence**: Confidence score 0.0-1.0\n- **triggers**: Evidence/foods that triggered this label (e.g., [\"fries\", \"bun\", \"sweet_drink\"])\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n[\n  {\"name\": \"carb_heavy\", \"confidence\": 0.82, \"triggers\": [\"pasta\", \"bread\", \"rice\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"missing_veg\", \"confidence\": 0.75, \"triggers\": [\"no_vegetables_observed\", \"corn_only\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"balanced\", \"confidence\": 0.65, \"triggers\": [\"protein_present\", \"vegetables_included\"]}\n]\n```\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null. These labels are critical for FDA explainability and RD review.\n\n### 9. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 10. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 11. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 12.

Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 15. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 16. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 17. Clinical Considerations\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified.

Positive Habits (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 4. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 5. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\n\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 6. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\n\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 7. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\n\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 8. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 9. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 10. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\n\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 11. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 12. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\n\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 13. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\n\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 14. Clinical Considerations\n\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching."}, "v3": {"patient_id": "649a16c54ea2df38e52849c8", "employee_id": null, "baseline_report": {"1.

Missing - recent food logs\",\n  \"primary_factors\": [\"T2D diagnosis\", \"HbA1c 7.8% (above target)\", \"Average BG 165 mg/dL\", \"Metformin 1000mg BID\", \"Self-reported inconsistent meal timing\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 5. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 6. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 7. Pattern Statistics (if food log data available - PRD Section 5)\nIf food logs are available, provide aggregate statistics for the RD dashboard:\n\n**balanced_percentage**: Percentage of meals that were balanced (0-100)\n**top_imbalances**: List 3-5 most common imbalances (e.g., [\"carb_heavy\", \"low_fiber\", \"missing_veg\"])\n**meal_frequency_per_week**: Average number of meals logged per week\n**consistency_score**: Assessment of logging consistency (e.g., \"Good - 5 days/week\", \"Irregular - 2-3 days/week\")\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null.\n\n### 8. Meal Pattern Labels (if food log data available - PRD Section 4)\nIf food logs are available, provide AI-assigned labels with explainability data:\n\nFor each recurring pattern, include:\n- **name**: Label name (carb_heavy, balanced, low_protein, missing_veg, fried_processed, sugary_drink_or_dessert, high_sodium_likely, low_fiber, high_added_fat, healthy_fat_present)\n- **confidence**: Confidence score 0.0-1.0\n- **triggers**: Evidence/foods that triggered this label (e.g., [\"fries\", \"bun\", \"sweet_drink\"])\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n[\n  {\"name\": \"carb_heavy\", \"confidence\": 0.82, \"triggers\": [\"pasta\", \"bread\", \"rice\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"missing_veg\", \"confidence\": 0.75, \"triggers\": [\"no_vegetables_observed\", \"corn_only\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"balanced\", \"confidence\": 0.65, \"triggers\": [\"protein_present\", \"vegetables_included\"]}\n]\n```\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null. These labels are critical for FDA explainability and RD review.\n\n### 9. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 10. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 11. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 12. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 13. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 14. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 15. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 16. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 17. Clinical Considerations\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching.\n"}}, "new_fields": {"v1": [], "v2": ["Executive Summary", "Data Coverage", "Positive Habits", "Improvement Areas", "Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations", "Key Nutrition Patterns", "Macronutrient Summary", "Meal Timing Patterns", "Food Choices Analysis", "Lab Correlations", "Prioritized Recommendations", "Narrative Summary", "Coaching Takeaway", "Clinical Considerations"], "v3": ["3.
