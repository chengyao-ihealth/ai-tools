Executive Summary\n\nProvide a 2-3 sentence overview of the patient's current nutrition-related health status based on available data.\n\n### 2. Data Coverage\n\nNote what data is available (medical history, lab results, medications, food logs, glucose data, etc.) and acknowledge any data limitations.\n\n### 3. Positive Habits (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 recurring positive nutrition habits based on available data, such as:\n\n- More protein intake\n- Consistent meal timing\n- Earlier dinners\n- Home-cooked meals\n- Balanced food choices\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, infer positive habits from patient background, goals, or general health maintenance patterns.\n\n### 4. Improvement Areas (2-3 items)\n\nIdentify 2-3 areas where nutrition could be improved, such as:\n\n- Frequent fried foods\n- Late-night snacks\n- Low vegetable intake\n- Irregular meal timing\n- Processed food consumption\n\n**Note:** If limited data is available, suggest improvement areas based on common gaps related to the patient's diagnosis and health goals.\n\n### 5. Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\n\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 6. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\n\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 7. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\n\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 8. Meal Timing Patterns (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze meal timing and frequency if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations.\n\n### 9. Food Choices Analysis (if food log data available)\n\nAnalyze food choices if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide general recommendations.\n\n### 10. Lab Correlations (if labs available)\n\nConnect lab values to nutrition interventions and explain how dietary changes could impact specific metrics.\n\n### 11. Prioritized Recommendations (3-7 items)\n\nProvide specific, actionable recommendations prioritized as High/Medium/Low with rationale.\n\n### 12. Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\n\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 13. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\n\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 14. Clinical Considerations\n\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified. Focus on creating actionable insights that RDs can use for patient coaching."}, "v2": {"patient_id": "68cb4ab2c53a530a6609ac0d", "employee_id": null, "baseline_report": {"1.

Glucose/Blood Pressure Correlations (if data available)\nIf glucose or blood pressure data exists, summarize clear correlations such as:\n- \"Carb-heavy dinners were often followed by higher overnight glucose\"\n- \"Consistent meal timing associated with more stable glucose levels\"\n\n**Note:** If no glucose/BP data is available, set this field to null.\n\n### 7. Pattern Statistics (if food log data available - PRD Section 5)\nIf food logs are available, provide aggregate statistics for the RD dashboard:\n\n**balanced_percentage**: Percentage of meals that were balanced (0-100)\n**top_imbalances**: List 3-5 most common imbalances (e.g., [\"carb_heavy\", \"low_fiber\", \"missing_veg\"])\n**meal_frequency_per_week**: Average number of meals logged per week\n**consistency_score**: Assessment of logging consistency (e.g., \"Good - 5 days/week\", \"Irregular - 2-3 days/week\")\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null.\n\n### 8. Meal Pattern Labels (if food log data available - PRD Section 4)\nIf food logs are available, provide AI-assigned labels with explainability data:\n\nFor each recurring pattern, include:\n- **name**: Label name (carb_heavy, balanced, low_protein, missing_veg, fried_processed, sugary_drink_or_dessert, high_sodium_likely, low_fiber, high_added_fat, healthy_fat_present)\n- **confidence**: Confidence score 0.0-1.0\n- **triggers**: Evidence/foods that triggered this label (e.g., [\"fries\", \"bun\", \"sweet_drink\"])\n\n**Example:**\n```json\n[\n  {\"name\": \"carb_heavy\", \"confidence\": 0.82, \"triggers\": [\"pasta\", \"bread\", \"rice\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"missing_veg\", \"confidence\": 0.75, \"triggers\": [\"no_vegetables_observed\", \"corn_only\"]},\n  {\"name\": \"balanced\", \"confidence\": 0.65, \"triggers\": [\"protein_present\", \"vegetables_included\"]}\n]\n```\n\n**Note:** If no food logs available, set this field to null. These labels are critical for FDA explainability and RD review.\n\n### 9. Key Nutrition Patterns (3-5 focus areas)\nIdentify key nutrition priorities based on the patient's health profile (diagnosis, medications, labs, goals).\n\n### 10. Macronutrient Summary (if food log data available)\nProvide macronutrient analysis if food logs are available. Otherwise, provide recommendations based on patient's diagnosis and health status.\n\n### 11.

Narrative Summary (2-4 sentences, ‚â§80 words)\nWrite a short professional narrative summary in clinical tone that an RD could edit or copy into notes. This should synthesize the key findings, positive trends, areas for improvement, and any data correlations.\n\n**Example format:**\n\"This month, meals were more balanced overall, with better protein inclusion at breakfast. Weekend dinners remain higher in fried foods and sugary drinks, often linked to glucose rises above target. Next month, focus on more vegetables at dinner and fewer fried takeouts.\"\n\n### 16. Coaching Takeaway (1 sentence)\nEnd with one coaching takeaway sentence for the RD to focus on with the patient.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Focus next on cutting back on sweet drinks\"\n- \"Emphasize earlier dinner times to improve overnight glucose control\"\n- \"Work on increasing vegetable variety at lunch and dinner\"\n\n### 17. Clinical Considerations\nFlag any concerning health indicators, medication-nutrition interactions, or areas requiring close monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Professional Clinical Tone**: Write as if communicating with healthcare professionals\n- **Be Specific and Evidence-Based**: Ground recommendations in nutrition science and clinical guidelines\n- **Handle Limited Data Gracefully**: If food logs or glucose data are not available, focus on baseline recommendations based on patient's diagnosis, medications, and health goals\n- **Avoid Absolute Claims**: Don't use terms like \"caused,\" \"treatment,\" or \"risk of disease\"\n- **Avoid Medical Dosing**: Don't recommend medication changes or diagnosis statements\n- **Be Supportive**: Use non-judgmental language even in professional context\n- **Consider Full Medical Context**: Account for all diagnoses, medications, and health conditions\n\n## HIPAA Compliance (CRITICAL)\n\n**Output must be de-identified**. Do NOT include:\n- Names, initials, addresses, phone, email, SSN, MRN, account numbers\n- Specific dates (use \"3 months ago\" instead of \"2024-01-15\")\n- Ages under 90 (use ranges: \"60-65 years old\")\n- Geographic details smaller than state\n\n**Use**: \"the patient\", relative timeframes, clinical data only.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your assessment in the structured JSON format specified.
